# AlterSeeK-Path

AlterSeeK-Path generates altermagnetic k-point paths for band-structure calculations. It inserts a general k point `k` and its spin-flip partner `k'` into a standard high-symmetry path, using the IBZ centroid as the default general point.

![AlterSeeK-Path example](./example/HEX.png)

**Current support:** VASP workflows. Quantum ESPRESSO support is partial.

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yujia-teng/AlterSeeK-Path.git
cd AlterSeeK-Path
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

After editable installation, the installed commands are available from any
calculation directory in the same Python environment. You do not need to copy the
Python scripts into each material folder.

---

## Quick Start

Run the command-line tool from any working folder containing your structure file:

```bash
alterseek-path
```

For development, `python alterseek_path.py` still works from the repository root.

The script guides you through five interactive steps:

| Step | What it does | Input needed |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| **0** | Finds spin-flip symmetry operations and prints a compact symmetry summary | Structure file; magnetic moments for non-mcif inputs |
| **1** | Builds or reads the high-symmetry IBZ path | Press Enter for auto path, or enter a KPOINTS-style file |
| **2** | Chooses the general k point | Automatic IBZ centroid by default |
| **3** | Selects the spin-flip operation | Press Enter for default, enter a number, type `list`, or type `manual` |
| **4** | Builds the altermagnetic path | Automatic |
| **5** | Saves the output | Output filename |

The default output file is:

```text
KPOINTS_modified
```

For cluster screening, install AlterSeeK-Path once in the environment used by
your jobs, then run `alterseek-path` inside each material calculation directory.
The command reads and writes files in the current directory.

---

## Inputs

### Structure file

- `POSCAR` / `.vasp`: magnetic moments are entered manually.
- `.cif`: magnetic moments are entered manually.
- `.mcif`: magnetic moments are read from the file when available.

For manual moments, enter values in atom order. Trailing non-magnetic atoms are filled with zero automatically, so `1 -1` is enough when the two magnetic atoms appear first.

### K-path source

- Press Enter in Step 1 to auto-generate the path.
- Or enter a line-mode `KPATH.in` / KPOINTS-style file.

## Example Terminal Session

```text
$ python alterseek_path.py
=== Altermagnetic K-Path Generator ===

>>> Step 0: Spin symmetry
Enter structure file (default: POSCAR, supports .vasp/.cif/.mcif): POSCAR
Magnetic moments (atom order, trailing atoms auto-fill to 0): 1 -1

Structure: POSCAR, atoms: 6
Space Group: P6_3mc (186)
Point Group: 6mm
Laue Group: 6/mmm
Magnetic SG: BNS ..., type ...
Spin group: COLLINEAR(axis=[0. 0. 1.])
Operations: 12 total, 6 spin-flip, 6 spin-preserving
Saved: spin_operations.txt, spin_flip_operations.txt, spin_preserve_operations.txt

>>> Step 1: High-symmetry k-path
IBZ type: hP2
Path: GAMMA-M-K-GAMMA-A-L-H-A | L-M | H-K
Press [Enter] to use this path, or type a filename to load your own:
Using HPKOT hP2 path (9 segments, 18 k-points)

>>> Step 2: General k-point
IBZ centroid: [0.277778, 0.111111, 0.250000]

>>> Step 3: Spin-flip operation
Found 6 spin-flip operations.
Default R: Option 1
Press [Enter] to use default, type a number, 'list' to show matrices, or 'manual':
Selected: Option 1

>>> Step 4: Build altermagnetic path
k' = [-0.1111, 0.3889, 0.2500]
Generated path: GAMMA-M-k | k'-M'-K'-k' | k-K-GAMMA-k | ... | L-M | H-K
Full path: 9 original segments -> 13 generated segments, 36 k-points

>>> Step 5: Save
Enter output filename (default: KPOINTS_modified):
Modified KPOINTS file written to: KPOINTS_modified

Done.
```

## Output Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `KPOINTS_modified` | Altermagnetic k-path for VASP line-mode band calculations |
| `spin_operations.txt` | Full spin-symmetry operation log |
| `spin_flip_operations.txt` | Spin-flip rotation matrices used by the main workflow |
| `spin_preserve_operations.txt` | Spin-preserving rotation matrices used for completion/diagnostics |
| `*_ibz_*.png` | IBZ/BZ figure with the selected general k point |
| `*_spinflip_*.png` | Spin-up/spin-down IBZ connection figure |
| `*_spinbz_*.png` | Spin-colored BZ figure |
| `*_spinbz_top_*.png` | Top-view spin-colored BZ figure |

For Laue groups `-1`, `-3`, and `m-3`, no altermagnetic splitting is supported. The code prints a note and writes the ordinary IBZ path.

## Band Plotting

After VASP and VASPKIT produce spin-resolved reformatted band files in the
calculation directory, run:

```bash
alterseek-path bandplot
```

By default this reads:

```text
KLABELS
REFORMATTED_BAND_UP.dat
REFORMATTED_BAND_DW.dat
```

and writes:

```text
alterband.png
```

Use PNG for quick checks and PowerPoint slides:

```bash
alterseek-path bandplot -o alterband.png
```

Use PDF for manuscript figures and Adobe Illustrator editing:

```bash
alterseek-path bandplot -o alterband.pdf
```

Matplotlib chooses the file format from the output extension. PDF is usually the
most convenient vector format for editing scientific plots in Illustrator, while
PNG is usually the most convenient raster format for presentations. If you want
both outputs, run the command twice with different `-o` values.

Optional arguments:

```bash
alterseek-path bandplot --emin -3 --emax 3 -o my_band.png
alterseek-path bandplot --klabels KLABELS --up REFORMATTED_BAND_UP.dat --down REFORMATTED_BAND_DW.dat
```

The standalone command `alterseek-bandplot` is also installed, but
`alterseek-path bandplot` is the recommended workflow for cluster runs.

## Additional Utilities

Standalone spin-flip analysis:

```bash
python find_sf_operations.py
```

IBZ centroid and BZ visualization for one structure:

```bash
python compute_centroid_hybrid.py POSCAR
```

Monoclinic IRBZ vertex diagnostic:

```bash
python find_irbz_vertices.py
```
